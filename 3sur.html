                    A legend claims that it was built in 629 AD, which makes it the oldest mosque in the Indian subcontinent 
                    which is still in use. It was built by Malik Deenar, Persian companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, on the orders of the successor of Cheraman Perumal, the Chera King of modern-day Kerala. The mosque was constructed in Kerala style with hanging lamps, 
                    making the historicity of its date claims more convincing.</p>
